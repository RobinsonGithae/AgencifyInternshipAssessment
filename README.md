## Fibonacci Problem
### Fibonacci
The fibonacci solution adds the previous two numbers in an array to give a sequence e.g 0,1,1,2,3,5
### Solution
In this solution A user:
Enters the value up to which the fibonacci sequence should reach. The java program then calculates the sequence and displaces the sequence as a list

### Implementation
This java code does not have a UI. The java code takes in the upper limit as input from the user using the Java Scanner class. The upper limit determines when the sequence should stop calculating.

An arraylist is used to store the results of the addition of the previous two numbers at each step.The arraylist items are then printed when the Sequence is complete.
